# Version Control
**Version control tool**: Git version control

Visual Studio Code provides a great embedded git interface. This interface includes things like showing who was the last person to edit the line you are one, how many changed files are unstaged, looking back through the git version history, and more. We also plan to use git submodules if necessary. This will help to allow for the website to be hosted from a different repository so that Docusaurus can be hosted from the main repository. The only other solution for this issue would be to host the website locally. This could be done but is not the preferred solution; therefore, git submodules will be used to accomplish the hosting of the website alongside Docusaurus.
