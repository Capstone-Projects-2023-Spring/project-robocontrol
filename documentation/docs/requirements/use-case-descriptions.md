# Use-case descriptions
Three use cases are described in detail below. Each use case represents a different method of using the application, with the third one combining first two. These scenarios outline the edge of the device’s capabilities showcasing the possibilities of the project. 

## Use Case #1
As a user, I want to be able to look for objects using the RoboControl’s camera. 

1.	The user powers on the RoboControl device. 
2.	The user navigates to the control website. 
3.	The user views the live camera feed on his/her device. 
4.	The user exits the website and powers down the RoboControl device. 

## Use Case #2
As a user, I want to be able to control the RoboControl so it is able to traverse through a custom obstacle course for entertainment.

1. The user powers on the RoboControl device. 
2. The user places the RoboControl in the desired starting position. 
3. The user navigates to the control website. 
4. The user uses the GUI with all the controls and maneuvers the robot through the course. 
5. The user exits the website and powers down the RoboControl device. 

## Use Case #3
As a user, I want the RoboControl to autonomously center, detect obstacles and manuever through a track defined by painter’s tape. 

1. The user powers on the RoboControl device. 
2. The user places the RoboControl in the desired starting position. 
3. The user navigates to the control website and enables ‘Autonomous Mode’. 
4. The RoboControl will automatically center and traverse through the course using computer vision. 
5. The RoboControl will also stop when it detects an obstacle using object detection and the ultrasonic sensor. 
6. At the end of the course, the user disables ‘Autonomous Mode’, exits the website, and powers down the RoboControl device.
