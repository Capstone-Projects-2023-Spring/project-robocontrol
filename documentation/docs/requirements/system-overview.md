# System Overview
Robocontrol provides a web-based user interface to control robotic devices such as the Adeept RaspTank. It will implement features such as obstacle detection, remote navigation, and autonomous functionality of the robot. The RaspTank has a Raspberry Pi 3B+ microcomputer which will interface with a remote server and GUI over Wi-Fi to process the data from the various input devices such as the on-board camera and ultrasonic sensor, as well as control the motor drivers for the tank treads and the servos for the mechanical arm. Video feed from the camera will be transmitted in near-real-time to the GUI so that the user can see where the robot is going even if they are not in the same environment and use this to navigate with controls on the GUI which will be transmitted back to the microcontroller via the server. If the user would prefer the robot to navigate its environment autonomously, the server will use camera and sensor information it receives from the microcontroller to make autonomous navigation decisions using Python and transmit these decisions back to the microcontroller so that they can be implemented by the servo motors in the robotâ€™s arm and tank treads.
