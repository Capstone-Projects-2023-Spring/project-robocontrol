# Features and Requirements
- Movement Control
  - User should be able to move robot forwards, backwards, and make turns by alternating direction of treads
  - User should be able to make slow turns without stuttering stops
  - User should be able to issue an emergency stop command in the middle of any movement operation
  - User should be able to sequence movement commands
  - Robot should be able to move in autonomous mode within established parameters
- Video Imaging
  - User should be able to receive video stream from robot
  - User should be able to receive screenshots of video stream
  - Robot should be able to upload video stream or snapshots in autonomous mode to the GUI
- Ultrasonic Sensor
  - User should be able to receive ultrasonic data indicating distance to nearest object
  - User should be notified if max range of ultrasonic sensor has been reached
  - Robot should be able to upload ultrasonic sensor data in autonomous mode
- Autonomous Mode
  - User should be able to enable and disable autonomous mode allowing robot to act within a set of parameters
  - Robot should have parameters established for autonomous mode allowing for movement within object or following distinct feature within video or ultrasonic sensor
  - Robot should be able to identify obstacles in autonomous mode and find routes to continue with issued commands
- Image Recognition
  - Video data or image data from robot should be fed into algorithm allowing for recognition of object in robots path
  - Video data or image data should allow for identification of follow parameters in autonomous mode or notification for user in control mode
  - Video data or image data should be processed to detect follow-lines of a specific color on each side of the robot
- World Route Construction
  - Ultrasonic and video data should enable web server to build graph of traversable paths
  - Server should have preset parameters defined allowing for scanning with video or ultrasonic data to identify traversable paths 
  - Graph data should be transmitted to robot to enable autonomous movement command sequencing
  - Follow-line data will be sent to the robot to stay in between the detected path
