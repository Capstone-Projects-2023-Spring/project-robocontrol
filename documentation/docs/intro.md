# Introduction

Robocontrol is a user-friendly way to interact with the Adeept RaspTank. The RaspTank is a small 'tank' with treads, a camera, an ultrasonic sensor, and an arm with a claw. In addition to the 'out of the box' functionalities of the RaspTank, our team has enhanced the user experience by creating an 'Autonomous' mode, which allows the tank to navigate an obstacle course without human intervention. 

## Features
By accessing the website (Ryanhodge.net), the user will be able to:

1. View the RaspTank's surroundings via a live camera feed
2. Manually control its movement and arm / claw with self-explanatory controls
3. Prompt the RaspTank to autonomously navigate an predefined course by enabling 'Autonomous' mode
