## This is a general outline only. 

#Define boundary lines (The line within which the robot will keep itself in between.)
    # Considerations for boundary lines
    # Are the lines the same color? Logically they would be however is there any reasonable scenario within which they will not be the same?
    # Does the robot find two lines that "match" as close as possible or are these boundary lines explicitly defined. In which case: 
        #How do the boundary lines get defined? Are they kept within a data field or is it user defined?
        #If it is user defined, how does the user input what is the boundary line? Is it by explicit RGB values, or a drop down list of colours, etc.
